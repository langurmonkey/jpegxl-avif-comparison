# JPEG XL vs AVIF comparison

Source images of my comparison of these image formats. The sources are all in PNG format, are in the public domain (CC0). `city-o.png` and `flag-o.png` are both ~4K images taken from https://free-images.com, downsampled to full HD, and saved losslessly to PNG. `plot-o.png` is a plot produced in matplotlib and saved in lossless PNG format. Its resolution was unchanged, 5760x4320.
